I have performed a broader sweep and fixed the `firebaseConfig` import issue in all remaining services, components, and context files within `client/src/modules/records`.

Modified files include:
- `services/NotificationService.ts`
- `services/dataService.ts`
- `services/customerAuthService.ts`
- `components/BottomNav.tsx`
- `components/NotificationListener.tsx`
- `context/RecordAuthContext.tsx`
- `context/CompanyContext.tsx`

This addresses the likely cause of the blank screen during app startup, as these core services were failing to initialize.
