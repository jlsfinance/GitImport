You have successfully implemented a global error handling system using codes (e.g., [DB-201], [ATH-101]) to make debugging easier.
You applied this system to:
- `Login.tsx`
- `Dashboard.tsx`
- `AllRecords.tsx`
- `AccountingApp.tsx`
- `DueList.tsx`

Additionally, you fixed the TypeScript errors in `AllRecords.tsx` regarding the `.toDate()` method and renamed all "Due" terminology to "Outstanding" in `AllRecords.tsx` and `DueList.tsx` as requested.

The user can now verify the changes by running the app.
